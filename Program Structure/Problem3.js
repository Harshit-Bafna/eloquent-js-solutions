/*Question
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
    characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
    or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
     # # # #
    # # # #
    When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
    = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
    of the given width and height.
*/

// Soltion

// Code to take Input from the user
// const gridSize = prompt("Enter the size of grid:") || 8;

let gridSize = 8;

for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; i++) {
    let gridRow = "";
    for (let j = 0; j < gridSize; j++) {
        if ((i + j) % 2 != 0) {
            gridRow += "#"
        } else {
            gridRow += " "
        }
    }
    console.log(gridRow)
}
